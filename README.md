***
At a time of darkness and uncertainty, at a time of unrest and strife, when the hearts of people are troubled, and they cannot find peace for their souls, in
such a time it is important, that the gospel of Jesus Christ reached the hearts of men, it is important, that the peace of God returns to their hearts. As long
as the grace of our heavenly father exists, everyone who seeks them should find them. The goal of this project is to create a website that shares the gospel of
Jesus Christ with people.
